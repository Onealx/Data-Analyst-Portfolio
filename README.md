# Data-Analyst-Portfolio

## About
I'm Faithful, hello! I have experience in economic analysis. I am now on pace to complete my M. BA, PGcert, Digital Marketing degree in Business Administration with Digital Marketing. I have a solid background in economics and a flair for analysing data for insightful information. As a beginning data professional, I am eager to contribute my technical and analytical expertise to the field of data science.

I improved my capacity for handling complicated data during my studies, and I also gained a sharp eye for seeing patterns and trends. Additionally, I developed skills in data administration, statistical analysis, and lab procedures, all of which I believe will be very beneficial in my position as a data specialist.
In my spare time, I like to experiment with new data analysis tools and methodologies, and I am always seeking for new ways to broaden my knowledge and skills. I am motivated by the pleasure of uncovering new insights and the gratification of using data to tackle challenging challenges, whether I am working in a team or on my own.
